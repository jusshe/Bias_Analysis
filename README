This repository houses all scripts and corpora used in my high school senior project.
With Professor Christiane Fellbaum’s oversight, I implemented a basic version of word2vec
and conducted web scraping to assemble a corpus composed of articles from CNN’s online
Politics section. In the future, I hope to compile corpora from other sites and compare 
embedding similarity across the corpora so as to analyze bias.
